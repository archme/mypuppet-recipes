My personal puppet recipes for Arch Linux

1. Make fresh arch install, and after first boot continue with this
2. pacman -Sy git
3. git clone http://github.com/archme/mypuppet-recipes.git
4. cd mypuppet-recipes
5. sh depinstall.sh && sh defaultconf.sh

You should then have a (basic) arch-system configured to my preferences ;)

TODO: 
- more recipes
- make configs "variable" through templates
- use one "main config" for centralized configuration
